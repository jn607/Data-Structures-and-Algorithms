What is the Big(O) time complexity of searching for an element in a list?

* O(n), linear - we have to iterate through the list until we find it.

Given an array of n elements, how many different triplets of elements can be formed in terms of Big O?

* O(n^3) - we have (n, 3) different combinations, which using the combination formula gives n^3 as our highest order.
                    

Given an array of n elements, how many different pairs of elements can be formed in terms of Big O?

* O(n^2) - we have (n, 2) different combinations, which using the combination formula gives n^2 as our highest order.
